# Form Validation Example

This project provides a simple HTML form with client-side validation using jQuery. It includes validation for email, phone number, and password fields, ensuring that all fields are filled out correctly and that passwords match.

## Features

- **Email Validation**: Checks if the entered email address is in a valid format.
- **Phone Number Validation**: Ensures the phone number field contains numeric values.
- **Password Confirmation**: Validates that the password and confirm password fields match.
- **Error Messaging**: Displays error messages if any validations fail.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the form and the embedded JavaScript/jQuery code.
- `Jquery.js`: jQuery library file (ensure this file is in the correct directory or use the CDN link provided in the HTML file).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    [it clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name](https://github.com/Abhishek3861/Login-Page-.git)
    ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a Browser**

    You can open the `index.html` file in any web browser to see the form and test the validation.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The form includes fields for email, phone number, password, and password confirmation.
2. **CSS Styling**: Basic styles are applied to format the form and its elements.
3. **JavaScript Validation**:
   - **Email**: Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
   - **Phone Number**: Checks if the input is numeric.
   - **Passwords**: Ensures that both password fields match.

## Usage

1. **Fill Out the Form**: Enter values into the form fields.
2. **Submit the Form**: Click the "Submit" button.
3. **Error Handling**: If any field is missing or invalid, an error message will be displayed below the form. Otherwise, an alert will confirm successful submission.

## Dependencies

- jQuery: Make sure jQuery is included in the project. The HTML file uses a CDN link for jQuery.
